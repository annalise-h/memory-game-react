The game starts with 16 face down cards on the table. On the other side of each card is a easily recognizable symbol, and there are 8 pairs of symbols arranged randomly among the 16 cards. The player will flip 2 cards at a time, trying to flip over 2 cards with the same symbol. If the player is successful, the cards remain flipped over. Otherwise, the cards are flipped back over. The player keeps trying to flip over pairs until all of the cards on the board are face up. The goal of the game is to match all the cards in as few flips as possible.
